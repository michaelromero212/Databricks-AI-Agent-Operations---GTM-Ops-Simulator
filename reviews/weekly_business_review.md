## Risk & Issues

### Active Risks

1. **🟡 Adoption Below Target**
   - **Risk**: May not hit Phase 1 WAU target (15 users) by end of pilot
   - **Mitigation**: Scheduled enablement session for Jan 13, manager endorsement campaign
   - **Owner**: Sales Ops

2. **🟢 Sample Size for A/B Testing**
   - **Risk**: Insufficient data for statistically significant A/B conclusions
   - **Mitigation**: Extended A/B test timeline, focused on qualitative feedback
   - **Owner**: AI Ops

### Closed Issues
- ✅ Intermittent timeout errors (TC012) - Fixed via API retry logic
- ✅ User feedback form not collecting responses - Form updated, now functional

---

## A/B Test Update

**Test**: Agent A (baseline) vs Agent B (enhanced prompts)  
**Status**: Completed initial analysis  
**Decision**: Continue with Agent A

**Summary**:
- Agent B did not meet success criteria (accuracy and satisfaction targets missed)
- Need to iterate on Agent B design based on user feedback
- Planning Agent C variant for next test cycle

**Next Steps**:
- Qualitative user interviews (week of Jan 13)
- Agent C development (targeting late January launch)

---

## User Feedback Highlights

### Positive Feedback
- "Saves me 20 minutes per lead - love it!" - SDR user
- "Follow-up suggestions are spot-on" - AE user
- "Great for data cleanup" - Ops user

### Improvement Requests
- Request: Support for multi-lead batch processing
- Request: Slack integration for agent outputs
- Request: Ability to save favorite queries/templates

### Issues Reported
- Issue: One user reported agent suggested outdated case study (escalated to content team)
- Issue: Confidence scores not always clear (added to product backlog)

---

## Operational Health

### Infrastructure
- **Uptime**: 99.8% (brief maintenance window Tuesday)
- **API Response Time**: p50 = 3.1s, p95 = 6.2s (within SLA)
- **Error Budget**: 98% remaining (healthy)

### Incidents
- **P3**: Brief API timeout on Jan 8 (1 user affected, resolved in 10 minutes)
- **No P0, P1, or P2 incidents**

---

## Decisions Made

1. ✅ **Continue Agent A, pause Agent B rollout**
   - Rationale: A/B test results inconclusive, need iteration
   - Decision Owner: AI Ops Lead
   
2. ✅ **Schedule Phase 2 planning for Jan 15**
   - Rationale: Phase 1 metrics strong, ready to expand scope
   - Decision Owner: Sales Ops Director

3. ✅ **Approve Slack integration scope for Q1**
   - Rationale: Top user request, high value-add
   - Decision Owner: Engineering Manager
